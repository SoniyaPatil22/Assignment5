**Assignment5Task1.py :**
**Features**
Predefined dictionary of student names and their corresponding marks.

Interactive input from the user to search for a specific student's marks.

Displays the marks if the student's name is found.

Displays a friendly error message if the name is not found.

**How It Works**
The program defines a dictionary called student_marks with student names as keys and their marks as values.

It prompts the user to enter a student's name.

It checks whether the entered name exists in the dictionary:

 If found, it displays the student's marks.

 If not found, it shows an appropriate message.
 
 **Output:**
 **If the student exist in the dictionary**:

 Enter the student's name: Alice
Alice's marks: 85

**If the student does not exist in the dictionary**:
Enter the student's name: john
Student not found.

**Assignment5Task2.py**
 **Description**
This Python script demonstrates basic list operations such as:

Creating a list of numbers.

Extracting a portion of the list.

Reversing the extracted elements.

Displaying both the original and modified lists.

It's a simple and beginner-friendly example to understand list slicing and reversing in Python.

**Functionality**
The program performs the following steps:

Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10 using the range() function.

Extracts the first five elements from the list using list slicing ([:5]).

Reverses the extracted list using slicing with a step of -1 ([::-1]).

Prints both the extracted list and the reversed version of that list.

**Output**
original list:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted First five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
